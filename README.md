# SMS-Email-spam-classifier

The dataset used for training the classifier consists of approximately 10,000 to 11,000 data points, scraped from Kaggle and Google Cloud.

# Steps

data preprocessing steps, which include cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text pre-processing, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

# Implementation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals that the dataset contains a mix of spam and non-spam messages, with around 80% being non-spam and 20% spam.
Further analysis showed correlations between different features in the dataset, aiding in understanding its characteristics.

Data preprocessing involved steps like converting text to lowercase, tokenization, removal of stop words and punctuation, and stemming.
Word frequency analysis helps in identifying key words associated with spam and non-spam messages.
Ham and spam messages will be showcased on the website for testing predictions.
The model successfully predicts spam messages based on provided samples.
